# Evaluation System - Complete Summary

## 🎯 System Overview

The evaluation system automates instructor workflows for student app-building assignments:

1. **Round 1**: Generate parametrized tasks → Send to students → Receive submissions
2. **Evaluation**: Automated checks (LICENSE, README, code, Playwright tests)
3. **Round 2**: Generate follow-up tasks → Send to qualified students → Evaluate again

## 🔧 What You Need to Do Manually

### ⚠️ CRITICAL (System Won't Work Without These)

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```powershell
   $env:GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
   $env:GITHUB_USERNAME="your_username"
   ```

2. **Update EVALUATION_URL** in:
   - `round1.py` line 25
   - `round2.py` line 23
   
   Change from `http://localhost:8000/api/evaluation` to your production URL.

3. **Prepare submissions.csv**
   - Export from Google Form
   - Format: `timestamp,email,endpoint,secret`
   - Save in `app-builder/` directory

4. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   ```powershell
   playwright install chromium
   ```

5. **Start API Server** (keep running)
   ```powershell
   python api_server.py
   ```

### ✅ See MANUAL_CHANGES.md for Complete Checklist

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Created

**tasks** - Task requests sent to students
- Fields: `email`, `task`, `round`, `nonce`, `brief`, `attachments`, `checks`, `evaluation_url`, `endpoint`, `statuscode`, `error`
- Unique: `(email, task, round)`

**repos** - Repository submissions from students
- Fields: `email`, `task`, `round`, `nonce`, `repo_url`, `commit_sha`, `pages_url`
- Unique: `(email, task, round)`

**results** - Evaluation results
- Fields: `email`, `task`, `round`, `check`, `score`, `reason`, `logs`
- Multiple rows per submission (one per check)

---

## 🎨 Task Templates

5 templates with Round 1 & Round 2 variants:

1. **image-viewer** - Image gallery → SVG support, zoom/pan
2. **calculator** - Basic calc → Scientific functions, memory
3. **todo-list** - Simple todos → Categories, filters, drag-drop
4. **weather-dashboard** - Current weather → Hourly forecast, charts
5. **quiz-app** - Multiple choice → Timer, categories, leaderboard

Each template has:
- Parametrizable briefs (vary by student/time)
- Attachments (images, JSON data, etc.)
- Evaluation checks (Playwright selectors)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Complete Workflow

```powershell
# 1. One-time setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
# Set environment variables (see MANUAL_CHANGES.md)

# 2. Start API server (keep running)
python api_server.py

# 3. Run Round 1
python round1.py submissions.csv
# Wait for student submissions...

# 4. Evaluate Round 1
python evaluate.py --round 1

# 5. Run Round 2
python round2.py
# Wait for student submissions...

# 6. Evaluate Round 2
python evaluate.py --round 2

# 7. Export results
python -c "from db import get_db; get_db().export_results_csv('results.csv')"
```

## 🔍 Evaluation Checks

### Automated Checks Per Submission

1. **Repo Creation Time** - Verify repo created after task time
2. **MIT LICENSE** - Check LICENSE file exists in root
3. **README Quality** - Evaluate sections, length, completeness
4. **Code Quality** - Check structure, functions, interactivity
5. **Playwright Tests** - Template-specific checks:
   - Element existence
   - Button clicks
   - Responsive design
   - JavaScript interactions

### Scoring
- Each check: 0.0 (fail) to 1.0 (pass)
- Results logged with `reason` field
- Export to CSV for grading

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### New Endpoint Added

**POST /api/evaluation**
- Accepts: `{email, task, round, nonce, repo_url, commit_sha, pages_url}`
- Validates nonce against tasks table
- Inserts into repos table
- Returns HTTP 200 on success, 400 on validation failure

### Existing Endpoints

**POST /api/build** - Student Round 1 builds
**POST /api/revise** - Student Round 2+ revisions
**GET /health** - Health check
**GET /docs** - Interactive API documentation

---

## 📝 Key Features

### Parametrization
- Tasks vary by student email and hourly timestamp
- Same template → different parameters per student
- Prevents cheating/copying

### Retry Logic
- 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1min, 3min, 10min)
- Logs all attempts to database
- Continues with next student on failure

### Deduplication
- Skips students who already have tasks/repos for a round
- Safe to re-run scripts

### Validation
- Email/task/round/nonce matching
- Prevents invalid submissions
- Clear error messages

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Check Round 1 Status
```powershell
sqlite3 evaluation.db "SELECT email, task, statuscode FROM tasks WHERE round = 1"
```

### View Submissions
```powershell
sqlite3 evaluation.db "SELECT email, pages_url FROM repos WHERE round = 1"
```

### Get Student Scores
```powershell
sqlite3 evaluation.db "SELECT email, AVG(score) as avg_score FROM results WHERE round = 1 GROUP BY email"
```

### Re-evaluate Specific Student
```powershell
sqlite3 evaluation.db "DELETE FROM results WHERE email = 'student@example.com' AND round = 1"
python evaluate.py --round 1
```

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing System

### How It Works with Your App Builder

1. **Students use their existing app-builder API** (`/api/build`, `/api/revise`)
2. **Evaluation system sends tasks** to student endpoints
3. **Students' systems build and deploy** as normal
4. **Students' systems POST back** to `/api/evaluation` endpoint
5. **Evaluation system evaluates** the submissions

### Student-Side Requirements

Students must:
1. Have `/api/build` and `/api/revise` endpoints working
2. Accept the JSON task format you send
3. POST back to `evaluation_url` with repo details
4. Use the same secret across all rounds

---

## ⚡ Performance

- **Round 1 generation**: ~1-2 seconds per student
- **Student API call**: Up to 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Evaluation**: ~10-30 seconds per submission (depends on checks)
- **Database**: Handles 1000+ students efficiently

### Parallelization

Currently sequential for safety. Can be parallelized for large classes:
```python
# In evaluate.py, use ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio.gather()
```

---

## 🛡️ Security

- Secrets verified via existing `secret_manager.py`
- Nonce validation prevents replay attacks
- Database transactions prevent race conditions
- No secrets exposed in logs (truncated)
- Playwright runs in sandboxed browser

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging
```python
# In any script
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Test Evaluation Endpoint
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/evaluation `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","task":"test-123","round":1,"nonce":"test-nonce","repo_url":"https://github.com/user/repo","commit_sha":"abc123","pages_url":"https://user.github.io/repo"}'
```

### View Logs
```powershell
# Real-time monitoring
Get-Content logs/round1.log -Wait

# Search for errors
Select-String -Path logs/*.log -Pattern "ERROR"
```
